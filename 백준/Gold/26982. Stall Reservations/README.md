### 문제 설명

<p>Oh those picky N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50,000) cows! They are so picky that each one will only be milked over some precise time interval A..B (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1,000,000), which includes both times A and B. Obviously, FJ must create a reservation system to determine which stall each cow can be assigned for her milking time. Of course, no cow will share such a private moment with other cows.</p>

<p>Help FJ by determining:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The minimum number of stalls required in the barn so that each cow can have her private milking period</li>
	<li>An assignment of cows to these stalls over time</li>
</ul>

<p>Many answers are correct for each test dataset; a program will grade your answer.</p>
